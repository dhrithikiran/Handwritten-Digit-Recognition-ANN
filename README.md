# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-ANN
This project identifies handwritten digits (0 to 9) using a neural network.

## What I used
- ANN (Artificial Neural Network) — Multi-class Classification
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, MNIST Dataset

## What the model does
- Takes an image of a handwritten number
- Predicts which digit it is (0 to 9)

## Files
- `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_ANN.ipynb` → main notebook with all code

## How to run
1. Download the notebook
2. Open in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells — dataset loads automatically (MNIST)
